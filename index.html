            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
            I am a PhD candidate in the Forest Engineering, Resources and Management Department in the College of Forestry at Oregon State University. 
            I am broadly interested in forest biometrics, with a specific affinity for remote sensing applications in large scale forest inventories. 
            Although much of my work revolves around remote sensing and statistics, I am also interested in developing software that assists in the 
            practice of forest biometrics.
