                <h2>Measuring forests</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a PhD candidate at Oregon State University studying forest biometrics. My particular focus is on large scale forest resource assessment
                    methods that leverage remote sensing data.
                    <br><br>
                    Remote sensing data, like lidar data acquired from aircraft, provide information <i>about</i> the forest, but we must rely on statistical inference
                    to make conclusions about its actual state and to assess the uncertainty of our predictions.
                    <br><br>
                    These concepts of <b>prediction</b>, <b>actual state</b>, and <b>uncertainty</b> are the central themes of my work in forest biometrics.
